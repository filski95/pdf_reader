macro reading materials from picklists and dumping them along with warehouse place to excel.


my company did not have a system tracing warehouse locations of materials. Work was done based on excel -> each location was manually checked and typed onto 
the picklist before people went to search for materials. (during a transition of warehouses - tthere was hardly any way to remember where was what as 
locations were quite dynamic). Picklists could contain 5 materials but also 40.

PDF readers reads off all material names from PDF files and compares them with the excel where locations were put and returns combined excel + multiple
excels for each picklist with stock location and materials.
